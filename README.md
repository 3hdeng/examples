# These are example snippets and BUILD files for [Bazel](github.com/google/bazel).

  * A [recipe](android-prebuilts/README.md) for configuring AOSP
    prebuilt toolchains for Bazel.

  * A [recipe](protobuf-2.5.0/README.md) for compiling the
    protobuf 2.5.0 compiler with Bazel. We used this with AOSP i686
    toolchain to produce the `protoc` binary in the Bazel repo.

  * A [BUILD file](re2/BUILD) for compiling RE2.
